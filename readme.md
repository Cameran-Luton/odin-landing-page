This was my second project after i started the odin project was super happy with the progress since the day before my website was just html so the progress felt good

during the day i learnt about the cascade in relation to css and a few different super common styling attributes after that i moved onto flexbox which made up a bulk of the days learning and then completed this project from scratch as a follow up to reinforce what i had learnt
